                approached me with a request: help her company wean off of the
                marketing platform Hubspot. They weren’t using Hubspot’s
                services enough to justify the monthly fee, but Saponaro, Inc.’s
                website would be full of broken links if they stopped their

                  Because the “CTA’s” were just glorified HTML links, I set out
                  to recreate them—removing the additional Hubspot functionality

                    <b>HTML/CSS</b>, <b>JAVASCRIPT</b>, and various plugins connected to a website can all affect the appearance of elements on the page. Sometimes, links would position themselves or resize themselves in ways I didn’t expect.
                  </p>
                    <p>
                      To correct this problem, I sought out the source code of the site, using <b>GOOGLE CHROME'S DEVELOPER TOOLS</b> to identify what was affecting the new content. Once I found the culprit, I wrote new code so the links displayed as they should.

                Ultimately, the links were successfully updated and Saponaro,
                Inc. was grateful to save some money each month. Working with
                Kelly to solve her company’s problem was a joy, and
                <strong>I learned a lot in the process:</strong>

              <p>
                My early conversations with Kelly were paramount in making this
                project a success. Through them I was not only able to identify
                the problem that needed to be addressed, but was able understand
                and empathize with the reasoning behind it. This created clarity
                and purpose for the job, and made it feel like we were in it
                together.

                Much of this work was repetative, and it would have been easy to
                assume that if the first updated link worked fine, the rest
                would too. But the tricky thing about web design is how
                elements can be affected by various outside sources, which can lead to
                inconsistencies from page to page.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sometimes a link wouldn't work the way I thought it would. The
                design would get messed up by some back-end stylesheet and I
                needed to find a way to fix it.
              </p>
              <p>
                By testing as I went I was able to catch those errors and make
                the necessary changes before it affected the end-user.

              <p>
                This may be an obvious lesson, but I was encouraged by the
                amount of gratitude Kelly expressed after I solved her company's
                problem.
